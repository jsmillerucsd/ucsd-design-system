## Components

Component *implementations* are not shared across frameworks and are not described here — a `.btn` in Bootstrap 5 and a `<Button>` in a React app can never share code. What they share is the token binding below and the behaviour contract in the skill's accessibility reference.

Write idiomatic code for whichever stack you are in. Correctness comes from binding to the right tokens, not from matching markup.

### Buttons

One primary action per screen. `btn-primary` is the affirmative action; `btn-secondary` carries everything else.

Every button fill has a matching label token — `color.component.btn.primary` with `color.component.btn.label-primary`, and the same for secondary and tertiary. Use them as a pair; mixing a fill from one variant with a label from another is how contrast failures happen.

Every interactive control has a visible hover state, a visible focus ring drawn from `color.theme.secondary`, and a disabled state that is legibly disabled rather than merely faded. Interactive controls meet the WCAG target-size minimum — never reduce it to fit a layout.

Label buttons with the verb for what happens: "Apply now", "Download the form". Never "Click here", never "Learn more" as the only label on a page with several of them.

### Forms

Every input has a visible, persistent label. Placeholder text is not a label — it disappears exactly when the user needs it, and it fails contrast at the sizes it is typically used.

Errors appear next to the field they concern, in text, using the `color.system.bg-error` and `color.system.foreground-error` pair. Color alone never carries the message: a red border with no text is invisible to a screen reader and to a red-green colorblind user. Validate on blur and on submit, not on every keystroke.

Help text sits below the field, in a muted text token, and stays visible.

### Navigation

Navigation is a landmark, uses real links, and marks the current page programmatically as well as visually. Dropdowns are keyboard-operable and close on `Escape`.

### Status and feedback

Status colors always appear as a `color.system.bg-*` background with its matching `color.system.foreground-*` half. Alerts carry an icon *and* text, never color alone. Toasts are for transient confirmations; anything the user must act on belongs on the page.

### Adding a component

The semantic layer is a curated, closed set. A new component binds to existing semantic tokens; it does not get its own token block by reflex. Component tokens exist only where a component genuinely needs a knob the semantic layer should not carry — and they alias semantics, never primitives, so they inherit dark mode for free.

### Tiles with Links

When generating a UC San Diego Tiles with Links module, use the established
UC San Diego CMS module pattern. Do not substitute a generic card grid,
feature grid, or custom tile implementation.

The module must use Bootstrap 5 conventions together with the established
UC San Diego module classes.

#### Visual contract

The Tiles with Links module is a constrained panel inside the page content
area. It is not a full-width color band.

The module must preserve the following visual relationships:

- The entire module is centered within the page's standard content container.
- The module background is applied to the constrained module panel, not to
  the full viewport width.
- The introductory row and the tile grid share the same left and right edges.
- The module includes substantial internal padding around both the introductory
  content and the tiles.
- The module heading and description appear on the left side of the introductory
  row.
- An optional module-level action appears on the right side of the same row.
- The tile grid appears below the introductory row.
- Standard desktop presentation is three equal-width tiles per row.
- Tile gutters are consistent across rows and columns.
- Tiles have the established rounded-corner treatment.
- Tile labels are centered horizontally and vertically within the tile.
- Image tiles use the established dark overlay treatment to preserve text
  readability.
- Solid-color tiles use only approved UC San Diego tile background treatments.

Do not make the module background bleed from edge to edge across the viewport
unless a separate documented variant explicitly calls for that treatment.

#### Structure

The outer section identifies the module and provides semantic grouping.

The constrained module panel sits inside the Bootstrap container.

The canonical hierarchy is:

- `<section class="jumbotron-tile-links" data-module="tiles-with-links">`
- `.container`
- `.tile-module-*`
- introductory `.row`
- tile `.row.tiles-row`
- responsive tile columns
- `.wrapper`
- `.background-image`
- `<h3><a>...</a></h3>`

The selected module surface is expressed with the appropriate
`tile-module-*` class on the constrained module panel, not on the full-width
outer section.

The introductory row:

- uses Bootstrap `.row`;
- places heading and description in `.col-md-8.text-indent`;
- places an optional module-level action in `.col-md-4`;
- uses Bootstrap 5 alignment utilities such as `.text-md-end`.

The tile grid:

- appears in a separate `.row.tiles-row`;
- uses `.col-md-4` for the standard three-column desktop layout;
- gives every individual tile a `.wrapper`;
- uses `.background-image` for both image and solid-color tile backgrounds;
- places each tile label in an `<h3>` containing the destination link.

#### Bootstrap 5 requirements

Use Bootstrap 5 markup and utilities.

Do not use Bootstrap 3 patterns that have been removed or superseded.

- Do not use `.jumbotron` as a Bootstrap component.
- Use `.text-md-end` or another appropriate Bootstrap 5 alignment utility
  instead of `.text-md-right` or `.text-lg-right`.
- Do not use `.btn-default`.
- Use an approved UC San Diego button treatment together with the appropriate
  Bootstrap 5 `.btn` classes.
- When an `<a>` performs navigation, style the `<a>` itself as the button.
  Do not place a `<button>` inside an `<a>`.
- Use the Bootstrap 5 grid for responsive tile layout rather than legacy
  float-based or Bootstrap 3 layout techniques.
