## Components

Component *implementations* are not shared across frameworks and are not described here — a `.btn` in Bootstrap 5 and a `<Button>` in the shadcn registry can never share code. What they share is the token binding below and the behaviour contract in the skill's accessibility reference.

Write idiomatic code for whichever stack you are in. Correctness comes from binding to the right tokens, not from matching markup.

### Buttons

One primary action per screen. `button-primary` is the affirmative action; `button-secondary` carries everything else; a third, quieter treatment handles tertiary actions. A screen with three primary buttons has no primary button.

Every interactive control has a visible hover state, a visible focus ring drawn from `color.border.focus`, and a disabled state that is legibly disabled rather than merely faded. Button height is floored at `button.min-height`, which is the WCAG target-size minimum — never reduce it to fit a layout.

Label buttons with the verb for what happens: "Apply now", "Download the form". Never "Click here", never "Learn more" as the only label on a page with several of them.

### Forms

Every input has a visible, persistent label. Placeholder text is not a label — it disappears exactly when the user needs it, and it fails contrast at the sizes it is typically used.

Errors appear next to the field they concern, in text, using the `color.status.danger` pair. Color alone never carries the message: a red border with no text is invisible to a screen reader and to a red-green colorblind user. Validate on blur and on submit, not on every keystroke.

Help text sits below the field, in a muted text token, and stays visible.

### Navigation

Navigation is a landmark, uses real links, and marks the current page programmatically as well as visually. Dropdowns are keyboard-operable and close on `Escape`.

### Status and feedback

Status colors always appear as a `-subtle` background with its matching `-strong` foreground. Alerts carry an icon *and* text, never color alone. Toasts are for transient confirmations; anything the user must act on belongs on the page.

### Adding a component

The semantic layer is a curated, closed set. A new component binds to existing semantic tokens; it does not get its own token block by reflex. Component tokens exist only where a component genuinely needs a knob the semantic layer should not carry — and they alias semantics, never primitives, so they inherit dark mode for free.
